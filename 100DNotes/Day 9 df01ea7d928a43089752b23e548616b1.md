# Day 9

There are many ways to style React with CSS, this tutorial will take a closer look at three common ways:

- Inline styling
- CSS stylesheets
- CSS Modules

For petes sake I will use CSS stylesheet as it is more convenient 
Css stylesheets and modules is actually good.

sass is a server side CSS instead of rendering the stylesheet on the browser the server do it on its end.

I may dive in to Sass in the future but for now lets focus on doing React. 

Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.

Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
